        WHAT?
        An event is a way for a class to notify other classes or objects 
        when something of interest occurs. Events are based on delegates.
   
        WHY?
        Events enable a class to provide notifications without knowing which 
        other classes or objects will receive those notifications. 
        This promotes loose coupling and separation of concerns.

        WHEN?
        Use events when you need a mechanism for one object to notify other
        objects about changes or actions.

        WHERE?
        Commonly used in scenarios like logging, monitoring, data changes, button click,
        keyboard clicks,and any situation where a notification mechanism is needed.
